## The story

This was a project that I completed as part of an Interactive Media class at Emerson College. I was inspired by the nostalgia of the early internet, where there seemed to be unlimited freedom and creativity. I wanted to contrast that with the modern (at the time) experience of the web - generic, static, identical Facebook pages.

## My contributions

I was the sole developer and designer for this project. It was built using the [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) with HTML/CSS/JS. The user is able to login with their Facebook profile, and then their information would be populated into a “geocities” style website.

I sourced all of the images for this site by scouring the Internet Archive’s [geocities collection](https://archive.org/web/geocities.php). Each time the user refreshes the page, they will receive a new combination of backgrounds, borders, and gifs.

## The result

This project is still cool over a decade later.

## What I learned

This was one of my first times working extensively with Javascript & APIs, so it took a lot of trial-and-error to reach the result I was looking for. Overall, I learned my first real lesson in how to find answers and read documentation.

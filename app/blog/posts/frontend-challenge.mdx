## The story

This project was a quick ‚ÄúTo-do App‚Äù challenge that I completed as part of an interview process. I was provided with a starter repo, a few design screenshots, and a list of user stories to complete.

User stories:

1. As a developer, I want to use¬†git.
2. As a user, I can create a new Todo.
3. As a user, I can view a list of Todos.
4. As a user, I can mark a Todo as complete or incomplete.
5. As a user, I can delete a Todo.
6. As a user, I see an error message when something fails.

## My contributions

I was the sole engineer on this project, building out the required features using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

In addition to recreating the designs provided, I added the [react-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti) package and used it to create a fun user interaction when all of the tasks are complete. üéâ

## The result

The submitted project was accepted, and I was able to move on to the next round of interviews.

You can see the full project on [github](https://github.com/mtrickett/frontend-challenge). Here is a snippet from the `TodosList.tsx` component's returned jsx:

```
<ul className="m-0 flex flex-col divide-y divide-slate-200 border-t border-slate-200">
  {filteredList.map((todo: Todo) => {
    return (
      <li key={todo.id} className="py-2.5">
        <label className="text-md group relative -mx-4 block rounded-xl border border-white p-4 font-medium hover:cursor-pointer hover:border-stone-200 hover:bg-stone-50">
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={todo.completed}
            className="appearance-none"
            onChange={() => handleChange(todo)}
          />
          <HiCheck
            className={`mr-3 inline-block h-9 w-9 rounded-full border-2 border-stone-300 p-1.5 text-center text-white ${
              todo.completed
                ? "border-none bg-green-600"
                : "group-hover:border-stone-400"
            }`}
          />
          {todo.title}
          <button
            onClick={() => handleDelete(todo)}
            className="absolute right-2 top-2 p-3 text-2xl text-stone-400 hover:text-red-600 group-hover:inline-block md:hidden"
          >
            <HiOutlineTrash />
          </button>
        </label>
      </li>
    );
  })}
</ul>
```

## What I learned

This project was the first time I worked with the SWR library, which I found very helpful in simplifying data fetching. However, I struggled a bit with finding the best patterns for code organization and error handling with SWR, and if I had more time I would revisit this implementation.
